The project is a web service for selecting a sports team and organizing sports events. <br/>
Any user can create a team, join any team, view the employment of sports grounds and individual teams. <br/>
For a more comfortable use of the service, a news feed is organized, in which news will be displayed in the area specified by the user as a location. By registering an event, the user can view upcoming events directly on the main screen, and, if necessary, view all the event history. Cancellation of registration and changing the time of the event is supported.<br/>
In the future, the separation of roles in the team will be available.

<br/>

Each user has a rank, which is determined by the number of matches and user ratings and is displayed for each player in his profile and as information about the player in the team.

Several graphic themes are supported: dark and light. In the future, their redesign and modernization.

For convenient orientation of users in a large number of teams, the display of the number of people in the team is implemented in different colors: red (from 1 to 2 people), yellow (from 3 to 4), green (5) and purple (6 people - full staff)
